image8bit
jQuery plugin to give images the aspect of good old 8-bit graphics.
The original img tag is replaced by a canvas tag, thus breaking jQuery fluent interface.

How to use?
$("img").image8bit({blocksize : 5, granularity : 16});

'blocksize' is the pixel size for the mosaic effect.
'granularity' limits palette color number (the higher, the fewer colors it gives).
